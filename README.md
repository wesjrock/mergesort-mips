# Mergesort-mips

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project was to implement a Mergesort algorithm in MIPS Assembly for the [Computer Organization and Architecture] course. It was made at the Computer Science undergraduate program from University of SÃ£o Paulo (ICMC - USP).

PROJECT
--------------------------------------------------
Given an unsorted array of maximum size 16, sort it through mergesort algorithm.
If the array size is between 1 and 4, sort it through bubble sort algorithm.

The code has to be implemented in two kinds of assembly, therefore there will be two files:
* MIPS Assembly
* ICMC Assembly (Simplified Assembly Implementation for Academic Purposes)

EXAMPLE 
--------------------------------------------------

MIPS Version running through QTspim

HOW TO ASSEMBLE
--------------------------------------------------
The following instructions are for the MIPS version 
```bash
	1. Install PCspim(Windows) or QTspim(Mac or Linux)
	2. Load the file
	3. Press the play button to run the program
```

MORE INFO
--------------------------------------------------
* Please check the file `project specification.pdf` to know more about this project.
* This code has been based on the C language mergesort algorithm which is in the file `merge_sort.c.zip`
* The ICMC Assembly version requires another assembler to mount and run the code, this assembly version was made to simplify the study of assembly concepts within this course.
